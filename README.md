# WikipediaGame

The Wikipedia is a game where players first select a target article that they will race to. The target article can be anything as long as it is not too obscure. Each player then clicks "Random Article" which is an option located in the main menu of any Wikipedia page. Now each player must navigate from the random article to the target article by clicking links embedded in each Wikipedia article. You cannot use the back button in your browser but Wikipedia disambiguation pages and links within the table of contents(1) are fair game.

(1) Note that although a person might use links embedded within the table of contents, the computer will not take any of these links into consideration.
